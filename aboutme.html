       <p> We use list.append() to add one list or set of items to another and tuples to alter unchangeable lists with operators. These were important to our Obamicon Projects because the list.append() added the color for a pixel based on the intensity, adding it to the recolored image list. The tuples were important for listing the RGB coordinates for the different colors. </p>
